# Frontend Mentor - Intro section with dropdown navigation

Coding this challenge was a lot of fun. Dropdown menus are an excellent way to
show more content without cluttering your navigation bar. I still need to work
on smoother animations and the active states when you click on the dropdown
menus. I tried using only CSS, but I think it would have worked better with
javascript, something to consider for future projects.
